# FRC-CLI-YouTube-Uploader
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NikhilNarayana/FRC-YouTube-Uploader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NikhilNarayana/FRC-YouTube-Uploader)

A YouTube Uploader for FRC Events.


## Current Feature Set:
* Asynchronous Upload Videos (single or batch uploads possible)
* Add to a YouTube Playlist
* Include match results from TBA in description
* Add videos links to The Blue Alliance automatically
* Mostly Automated, Non-Blocking Web Interface
* Saves and Reads form values to and from CSV


## How to Setup
1. Install Python 2.7 for your OS with the PATH added and make sure there are no other versions of python 2.7.
2. Clone this repository into a subfolder of the folder that will contain the videos
3. Install the requirements for the script with `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`, or `make` if supported by your OS
4. Add the thumbnail to the same folder as `thumbnail.png`
5. Make your recording program follow this naming scheme: [EVENT_NAME] - [MATCH TYPE] ex. 2016 Indiana State Championship - Qualification Match 1. Also use the Tiebreaker scheme when necessary.
5. Start the program by running `python frcUploader` and navigating to `localhost:8080` in your browser or by using the .bat file for Windows or .sh file for Linux/macOS
6. Add in the necessary info.
7. Hit submit everytime a match finishes. No need to update any values unless you are entering eliminations or doing ceremonies.
8. Enjoy not having to deal with YouTube's front end 

### Web UI Breakdown
![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/z9PxgCP.png)

I focused on simplicty and usability. All the necessary details fit into one small space allowing you to easily place this anywhere on your screen without needing to see all of it.

##### Match File Locations
You can now pick whether the match files  are in the same folder as the scripts or the one above. Default is the one above (parent folder).

##### Production Team/Facebook Name/Twitter Handle/Website Link
Constants that used to be in the script itself, you can now edit them as you see fit without going into the code.

##### Event Name
You can name this as you wish, but it should also be used at the start of every video filename. Generally includes [YEAR] [NAME OF EVENT]

##### Event Code
Find this at TheBlueAlliance in the address bar of the event page. It generally follows [YEAR][EVENT_CODE] format such as 2016arc or 2016incmp.

##### Playlist ID
You can find the playlist ID on the playlist page's web address. Every playlist ID starts with PL making them easy to identify.

##### TBA Event ID/Secret
Both of these must be obtained by contacting TBA at contact@thebluealliance.com for the keys to your event. If your event is not on TBA I suggest you just uncheck the `Use The Blue Alliance` checkbox and not worry.

##### Video Description
The description used in the program is fairly lengthy, but adds a lot of info that can be nice to have. The usual description is found in `youtubeup.py`. If you would rather not use that description feel free to input your own.

##### Match Number
Fairly self-explanatory, just remember to reset the value when you go into each stage of eliminations. This value will increment each time you press "Submit".

##### Last Match Number
If you want to batch upload a number of files you can do so with this. Every match between `Match Number` and this number, inclusive, will be uploaded and added to TBA. It will then replace this textbox with the original string and update Match Number to the last match uploaded + 1.

If you are still in need of assistance, feel free to contact me.

## Extra Scripts
### updatePlaylistThumbnails.py
This script expects two inputs, a playlist ID (`--pID`) and a thumbnail file name (`--tnail`). It will then update every the thumbnails of every video in that playlist to the one you provide. This makes it simple to update older playlists with a new thumbnail so you can keep your look consistent.

### addTBAToDescription.py
addTBA will add match information to the video description retroactively. This script runs similarly to `start.py`. You start it with `python addTBAToDescription.py` and navigate to `localhost:8080` to use to script. You have to provide the video url, event code, and match code. Future goal is to add title to this

These scripts are not used within start.py
